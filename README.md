# Integration-of-a-pre-trained-deep-learning-model-into-slicer3D-scripted-Module

3D Slicer is a free, open source and multi-platform software package widely used for medical, biomedical, and related imaging research

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation

Integration of keras deep learning model into 3D slicer will unlock great potential in the domain of medical imaging research.

In this repository , I have shared a code in which i have clearly expalined how to integrate a keras deeplearning model into 3DSlicer.
Additionally i have shared the picutre of a user interface from the above mentioned 3DSlicer module which contains keras deeplearning model.
